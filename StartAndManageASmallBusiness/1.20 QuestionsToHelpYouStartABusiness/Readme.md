### What are you going to call your business?
•	Do Your Due Diligence: Before committing to a business name, ensure no one else is using it. This involves searching the web, checking the USPTO database, and looking at corporate names and LLCs filed in your state. 
•	Trademark Considerations: The first party to use a name has senior rights under U.S. trademark law, even if they haven't registered it. Big companies use trademark attorneys, but you can do your own research. 
•	Resources: You can use services like trademarkbank.com to help with your search and consider checking out Dana Robinson's full course on LinkedIn Learning for more detailed guidance on the trademark process. 
### Are you going to have partners?
•	Define Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly outline what each partner needs to do to earn their shares. Avoid giving equal shares without considering individual contributions. 
•	Employment Agreement: Have all partners sign an employment agreement and ensure their shares vest over time to keep them committed. 
•	Protect Your Business: Draw up an agreement that spells out responsibilities and expectations to protect yourself and your business from partners who may not contribute equally. 
### What is the type of entity that you want to form?
•  No Entity Needed: If you are starting a business alone with your own money, you might not need any entity and can operate with a fictitious business name or DBA. 
•  LLC or Corporation: If you have partners, consider forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or a corporation to share ownership and shield against liabilities. 
•  Tax Considerations:
•	For individuals with no partners, an LLC can simplify tax filings. 
•	For highly profitable businesses, an S corporation can offer tax advantages. 
•	For startups relying on venture capital, a C corporation might be suitable despite double taxation. 
### What’s your money situation?
•	Assess Your Finances: Before starting a business, create a budget based on money you can afford to lose. Avoid using retirement savings or incurring debt if you're new to business. 
•	Funding Options: Consider different funding sources like personal savings, unexpected windfalls, loans, or investments from others. 
•	Strategic Use of Funds: If experienced, use a mix of your own money and investor funds to set up the business, ensuring you have legal, accounting, and business advisors. 
### What’s your time situation?
•	Time Management: Efficiently manage your time, especially if you're starting out alone. Consider outsourcing low-cost tasks to free up time for higher-value work. 
•	Prioritize Tasks: Use services like Task Rabbit for personal errands and say no to non-essential tasks to focus on your business. 
•	Temporary Sacrifices: Be prepared to cut back on leisure activities and travel temporarily until your business is up and running. 
Carefully assess and budget your time as if it was money to ensure your new business and resulting lifestyle thrive.
### Do you have access to capital?
•	Identify Funding Needs: Determine the type of business you're starting to understand your financial needs, as they vary greatly (e.g., a nail salon vs. a software application). 
•	Fundraising Process: For businesses needing significant investment, understand the stages of fundraising, including "friends and family" rounds, seed rounds from angel investors, and series A funding from sophisticated investors. 
•	Financial Planning: Do thorough homework on funding sources before starting your business to avoid draining personal savings or going into debt. 
 Understanding your financial pathway is crucial to the success of your venture.
### Do you know your customer?
•	Identify Your Target Customer: Clearly define a specific target customer rather than trying to appeal to everyone. Understand their pain points and motivations. 
•	Create a Customer Avatar: Develop a detailed profile of your ideal customer to guide your marketing efforts, content creation, and pricing strategies. 
•	Shape Your Business Around the Customer: Use the knowledge of your target customer to shape your business, ensuring your marketing and product/service offerings are effectively aligned with their needs. 
### What is your skill?
•	Leverage Existing Skills: Starting a business in a field you know well is like a superpower. It gives you an unfair advantage and reduces risks. 
•	Avoid Unfamiliar Fields: Many business failures stem from entering industries outside one's core competencies. Stick with what you know to hedge against failure. 
•	Prepare for Unknowns: If you venture into an unfamiliar field, take significant steps to prepare and educate yourself to mitigate risks. 
### What is the worst that can happen?
•	Assess Risks: Consider the worst-case scenario in your business venture. Understanding the potential downsides helps in making informed decisions. 
•	Willingness to Take Risks: Evaluate if the worst-case scenario is a risk you're willing to take. Sometimes, even the worst-case can have an upside or be survivable. 
•	Contrast with Best Case: Compare the worst-case scenario with the best-case scenario to gain clarity on whether to proceed with your business idea. 
### What is your backup plan?
•	Plan for Flexibility: Having a backup plan isn't about expecting failure; it's about being smart and prepared. Be ready to pivot if necessary. 
•	Maintain Relationships: If your backup plan involves returning to a previous job, keep those relationships positive and avoid burning bridges. 
•	Side Work for Stability: Many entrepreneurs keep their businesses afloat by taking on side work to pay the bills. Stay flexible and open to evolving your business idea if needed. 
### Who are your competitors?
•	Competitors Indicate a Market: Having competitors is a good sign because it means there is an existing market for your product or service. 
•	Avoid Creating a Market: If there are no competitors, it might indicate that there is no market, which can be costly and time-consuming to create. 
•	Differentiate Yourself: Learn about your competitors to identify what sets them apart and find gaps in the market that you can use to compete effectively. 
### What networks can you leverage?

•	Value of Networking: Your network is a crucial asset, providing advisors, customers, vendors, and future employees. It's as important as financial capital. 
•	Start Early: Begin building your network well before starting your business to avoid starting with no relationship capital. 
•	Networking Tips: Attend industry events, smaller gatherings, and masterminds. Use platforms like meetup.com to find relevant groups and consider taking Dana Robinson's networking course for more guidance. 
### What are the industry events relevant to your industry?
•	Importance of Trade Shows: Attending industry trade shows can provide invaluable insights and networking opportunities, helping you learn more about your industry. 
•	Networking Opportunities: Trade shows offer chances to meet experienced professionals, lawyers, CEOs, and sales reps, and to attend various side events. 
•	Do Your Research: Identify and participate in major industry events to stay informed and connected within your field. 
### Where do you find mentors?
•	Seek Out Business Incubators and Accelerators: These programs are designed to mentor new entrepreneurs and can be a great resource. 
•	Attend Industry Events: Networking at industry events can help you connect with seasoned veterans who can offer advice and make valuable connections. 
•	Professional Relationships: Hire attorneys and accountants who work with other local entrepreneurs and ask them for introductions to potential mentors. 

Finding mentors can significantly speed up your entrepreneurial progress and provide valuable guidance.
### What does success look like?
•	Define Success Clearly: Understand what success looks like in one, two, and three years. This helps in setting realistic goals and creating actionable plans. 
•	Work Backwards from Goals: Break down your long-term goals into smaller, manageable milestones. For example, if you aim to sell a certain number of units in three years, determine what needs to be achieved at each preceding stage. 
•	Create a Roadmap: Develop a detailed plan outlining what needs to be done each month over the next 36 months. This helps in staying on track and making necessary adjustments. 

Having a clear vision of success and a roadmap to achieve it is crucial for effective business planning.
### What does copyright mean to you?
•	Avoid Copyright Infringement: Never use images or text from the web without permission, as this can lead to costly legal issues. 
•	Use Royalty-Free Resources: Obtain images and video clips from royalty-free stock image websites or have contractors create original content with proper agreements. 
•	Create Value and Avoid Risks: Ensure that all creative pieces used in your business are legally secured to avoid risks and add value to your business. 

Understanding and respecting copyright laws is essential to avoid legal troubles and protect your business.
### What does patent mean to you?
•	Patent Basics: A patent protects utilitarian ideas that are novel and non-obvious, giving you the sole right to practice it for 20 years. 
•	Research Thoroughly: Use resources like Google Patents to ensure your idea is unique and hasn't been done before. 
•	Practical Value: Patents only have value if you put them into practice. They require investment in time and money to grow a venture around your idea. 
Understanding these points helps in making informed decisions about whether pursuing a patent is worthwhile for your business.
### Why are you going into business?
•	Identify Your Why: Understand the core reason for starting your business, such as seeking freedom and control over your time and money. 
•	Build for Freedom: Create a business that aligns with your why, ensuring it provides the freedom and lifestyle you desire. 
•	Plan for Systems: Implement systems and processes from the start to work on the business, not just in it, enabling long-term success and freedom. 

Taking the time to identify your why and planning accordingly is crucial for building a successful and fulfilling business.
### Is there a unified management solution for your business? 
•	Unified Management Solutions: Using a single software tool can solve many business problems, create systems and processes, and allow you to focus on core business activities. 
•	Efficiency and Cost: Unifying management tools can save time and reduce the need for multiple communication channels and software, avoiding the high cost of building a custom system. 
•	Empowerment: Finding a comprehensive solution helps you concentrate on acquiring customers rather than managing inefficient processes. 

These points highlight the importance of streamlining your business operations with a unified management solution.
### What is your core competence?
•	Focus on Your Strengths: Identify and concentrate on the one thing you do best. Trying to offer too many services can dilute your effectiveness and lead to mediocre results. 
•	Avoid Distractions: Chasing new opportunities that are outside your core competence can drain resources and create problems, as illustrated by the instructor's personal example of an audio book business. 
•	Long-Term Success: Sticking to your core competence helps in scaling your business and achieving long-term success. 

These points emphasize the importance of staying focused on what you do best to grow your business effectively.
